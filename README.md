# Fuzzy-SOINN
Fuzzy SOINN is written in JAVA.

Running Enviroment:
Java JDK 1.8
in IDE Eclipse

the Launcher can run for artificial data sets, and the TestData can run for real-world data sets.
Data sets are too big to conclude in the project,so I delete them. You can get the real-world date sets all from the Internet.
If the preformance is not so well, please try to adjust the parameters!

If you have any questions, please contact njucszty@gmail.com.
